This project focuses on predicting student exam scores based on various academic and socio-demographic factors using different linear regression approaches.

ðŸ“Œ Project Workflow

Data Loading & Exploration:

Imported the dataset and performed initial inspection for structure, missing values, and data types.

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values in Teacher_Quality, Parental_Education_Level, and Distance_from_Home using mode imputation.

Applied Label Encoding to convert categorical features into numerical form.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generated pie charts, count plots, and scatter plots to visualize categorical distributions and feature-target relationships.

Correlation Analysis:

Computed correlations with Exam_Score and identified Attendance as the strongest predictor.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Simple Linear Regression: Trained with Attendance as predictor (highest correlation).

Multiple Linear Regression: Trained using all features except the target variable.

Polynomial Regression (degree 2): Trained with all features to capture potential non-linear patterns.

Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score on both training and test sets.

ðŸ“Š Results & Insights

Simple vs. Multiple Linear Regression:
Both models yielded similar RÂ² and MSE, suggesting that most additional features contributed little predictive power compared to Attendance.

Polynomial Regression:
Outperformed linear models with higher RÂ² and lower MSE, indicating that non-linear relationships exist between features and exam scores.

âœ… Key Takeaways

Attendance is the most significant linear predictor of exam performance.

Adding weakly correlated features did not improve linear models.

Polynomial regression better captured feature interactions and non-linear trends, improving overall predictive accuracy.
