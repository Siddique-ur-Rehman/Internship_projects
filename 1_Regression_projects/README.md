# Student Performance Prediction

This project explores the prediction of student exam scores using various linear regression techniques based on factors such as attendance, parental education, and teacher quality.

## Project Overview

The project workflow included:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Loading, initial exploration, handling missing values by imputation (mode), and encoding categorical features (Label Encoding).
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing feature distributions and relationships with the target variable ('Exam_Score').
3.  **Feature Analysis:** Assessing feature correlation with 'Exam_Score'.
4.  **Model Development & Evaluation:** Training and evaluating Simple, Multiple, and Polynomial (degree 2) Linear Regression models.

## Model Performance Summary

The project evaluated three linear regression models. Key evaluation metrics (MSE and R-squared) were used to assess their performance on both training and testing datasets.



## Key Findings

The analysis revealed insights into the factors influencing student performance and the predictive capabilities of different linear regression approaches.
